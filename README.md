 Some Problems for the beginners in C++
 
Answer submission procedure

- Create an issue (if want to solve Problem 1 then create an issue as Problem 1 solution) then get assigned by admin (first come first service) and then start solving it   
- If question asks for Bug or the what does the program do then edit the readme file and specify the bug like: "### Problem "number" "newline" - Bug1/output "text" "newline" -Bug2/output "text"...."
- If question asks for Bug and correct it, first specify the bug and submit the corrected file name as "Problem number_sol"
- If solving issues then answer in readme file using the discussed convention and then upload the file(if asked)

Example How to specify?

### Problem 1
- Bug 1/output
- Bug 2/output
- .
- .
- Bug n/output
- Then upload the file if necessary

## OR

## Answers

### Problem 6
- Issue number-13
 
output will be 

Enter number of rows: 5

1

2 3

4 5 6 

7 8 9 10 

11 12 13 14 15 

output is called-Pascal's Triangle.

### Issue 2
 Checking equality without using comparison or arithmetic operator:
 - using bitwise XOR
 
### Problem 10 
- Rotates the array circular right

### Problem 8
- This program calculates the sum of digits till a single digit is obtained, for ex:

  534=> 5+3+4=12
  
  12=> 1+2=3. 
  
  So output would be 3.
